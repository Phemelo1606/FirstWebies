                <p>My name is Phemelo Shopelekae, and I have chosen to focus my topic on the trading sector. Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic occurred countries were forced to shut their boarders as a way to lower the spread but this lead to the trading sector to suffer a heavy loss I had to find ways which were researched by professionals to counter this these loss both international and national. </p>

    <p>Currently there is a big problem that arose due to the covid-19 pandemic in South Africa. Its trading sector has fallen under ruin as its infrastructure has been shaken and its trade halted. My intention is to find new solutions on how we can improve the trading sector in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. My investigation will be focusing on South Africa’s trade during the covid-19 pandemic, the challenges this country faced concerning its trade in this trying time and finding innovative ICT solutions to those challenges <cite><b>(IG, n.d.)</b></cite></p>
        <p>Sectors trading is used by traders who want to gain exposure to a specific area of the economy, for example the oil and gas sector. With sectors trading, you can get exposure to a basket of related stocks – from the same index and industry – with a single trade. This enables you to go long or short on the sector as a whole without buying and selling companies’ individual shares.<cite><b> (IG, n.d.)</b></cite></p>
