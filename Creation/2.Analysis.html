    <p>South Africa is known for its trade in raw materials such as iron, gold, diamonds and platinum. South Africa is a member of the BRICS, the group of emerging world economies include China, Brazil, Russia and India. In knowing these, it’s pretty obvious that south Africa mostly trades with other countries. <cite><b>(ITC by country, 2014)</b></cite></p>
    
    <p>Due to the covid-19 restrictions, trade was forcefully stopped in order to preserve human life. Countries closed their boarders and by doing so they also closed their way of trading with other countries. Export and import trade became impossible. Businesses had to lock their doors due to the nationwide lockdown, many of South Africa’s work force was left without work increasing our counties unemployment rate and poverty. <cite><b>(Merten, 2020)</b></cite></p>
    
    <p>This decade got off to a challenging start with the COVID-19 pandemic impacting all aspects of life in South Africa. Trade is no exception and this paper is written at a time when it is not clear what the future will hold for South African traders or the multilateral trading system. The authors have reflected on key aspects of South Africa’s existing trade partnerships and captured issues that could form part of a trade policy for the 2020s. It is still a time of extreme uncertainty and the economic climate is rapidly changing in South Africa-. This presents particular difficulties for policymakers and adaptability will be a defining trait required for the decade ahead. <cite><b>(Marak, n.d.)</b></cite></p>
        
<p>Trade restrictions have been one of the tools used by countries to deal with COVID-19.The response has included export controls and the reduction of tariffs, particularly on medical supplies, personal protective equipment and pharmaceuticals. These have gradually been removed as countries reopen their economies, but it is expected that we will now see a renewed focus on import substitution as a policy preference. This has already been flagged in the thinking of the African National Congress (ANC) as it sets out a vision for a ‘new South African economy’. ‘SA’s Economy after the Covid-19 – an Iron Fist in the ANC’s Velvet Glove’ <cite><b>(Merten, 2020)</b></cite></p>
        
<p>ICT may reduce the fixed entry cost into a market and thus stimulates exports. As Freund and Weinhold (2004) discuss, these fixed costs include the costs of finding out information about the market (search cost), advertising, and establishing a distribution network. By reducing delays in acquiring and transmitting information, the use of ICT also makes planning more efficient and accurate. Consequently, the volume of trade between countries is expected to go up. <cite><b>(Nath & Liu, 2017)</b></cite>. Businesses are digitising their way of trade. E-commerce is a new way of trading goods and services via the internet. Industries can save manufacturing cost by using automated robotics in their assembly lines.

    <p>The graph above shows consequences the people had to face due to the national Lockdown. Based on the questionnaire people had to choose between four options that are “It did not affect me”,” It made it hard to trade”,” I could not buy the things I needed” and “It forced stores to close”.</p>
